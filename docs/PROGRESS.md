# Endure — Progress Log

## 2026-02-07

- Backend domain spine generated:
  - models + relationships
  - migrations
  - policies
  - API resources
  - API controllers (stubbed)
  - API routes
- Added `role` to users (`athlete`, `coach`, `admin`)
- Registered policy mappings for core training entities
- API auth decision recorded: use Fortify/session `auth` middleware (no Sanctum in baseline)
- Phase 2A started: dashboard now reads real training plan data from `GET /api/training-plans` (nested weeks/sessions), read-only
- Added frontend transformer layer for training plan API payloads to keep UI decoupled from raw response shape
- Dashboard data loading moved to Inertia server props (no client-side fetch for plan reads)
- Implemented TrainingWeek read endpoints (`index`, `show`) with policy-aware scoping and nested sessions
- Added read performance controls for TrainingPlan + TrainingWeek index endpoints:
  - `per_page`
  - `starts_from`
  - `ends_to`
  - paginated response shape (`data`, `links`, `meta`)
- Added/updated API tests for:
  - training plan pagination + date filters
  - training week read access behavior
  - authenticated endpoint behavior updates
- Implemented TrainingSession read endpoints (`index`, `show`) for calendar backbone
- Added TrainingSession read filters:
  - `from`
  - `to`
  - `training_plan_id`
  - `training_week_id`
- Added TrainingSession read tests for:
  - auth requirements
  - athlete own-data access
  - athlete forbidden cross-user access
  - admin full access
  - coach empty collection behavior
  - date window filtering
- Implemented TrainingWeek CRUD (`store`, `update`, `destroy`) with policy checks
- Added explicit TrainingWeek write validation via FormRequests:
  - required `starts_at` / `ends_at`
  - date ordering (`starts_at < ends_at`)
  - non-overlapping weeks within the same training plan
- Added focused TrainingWeek CRUD API tests for auth, ownership, admin, overlap, and invalid date ranges
- Added deterministic visual verification seeders:
  - `VisualSeeder`
  - `Visual/AdminVisualSeeder`
  - `Visual/CoachVisualSeeder`
  - `Visual/AthleteVisualSeeder`
  - deterministic role users + predictable plan/week/session calendar data
- Implemented role-aware navigation shells (athlete/coach/admin/settings route surfaces)
- Refactored athlete calendar to slicing-first composition using real backend data:
  - single calendar canvas
  - fixed top calendar header
  - fixed weekday row
  - sticky week headers
  - 7 aligned day columns + right weekly summary rail
  - read-only interaction posture preserved
- Reworked sidebar from starter-kit panel navigation to slicing-style fixed icon rail:
  - icon stack + active blue indicator dot
  - role-aware nav visibility retained
  - role badge + sign-out controls aligned to slicing layout
- Removed/neutralized starter-kit visual token drift:
  - slicing-aligned dark tokens in `resources/css/app.css`
  - Inter + JetBrains Mono font loading in app shell
  - bootstrap background set to slicing dark to avoid initial flash mismatch
- Updated calendar session visuals toward slicing `SessionCard` behavior:
  - removed planned badge
  - status icon rules aligned
  - mono metric row + left sport accent strip + density/rhythm parity updates
- Updated docs to track frontend slicing convergence and backend readiness

## 2026-02-08

- Completed athlete calendar visual parity hardening pass (frontend-only, read-only behavior unchanged):
  - scroll ownership locked to calendar canvas (page wrapper overflow hidden)
  - duplicate day-column vertical separators removed
  - current-week emphasis reduced to subtle header treatment (no full-week tint / left stripe)
  - weekly summary rail width adjusted to slicing proportions
  - week/day vertical rhythm normalized for consistent band height
  - day-cell inset spacing tightened for closer date-to-session scan flow
  - planned-session contrast increased (title + primary duration metric)
  - session metrics restructured to stacked mono duration/TSS blocks
  - planned-state right-side marker aligned to slicing composition
- Verified frontend safety with targeted TypeScript check (`npm run types`) after the pass.
- No backend/API/routes/policy changes in this update.
- Implemented TrainingSession write support (backend-only):
  - added `StoreTrainingSessionRequest`
  - added `UpdateTrainingSessionRequest`
  - added enum-backed sport validation via `TrainingSessionSport` (`swim`, `bike`, `run`, `gym`, `other`)
  - enforced session date within selected `TrainingWeek` range
  - enforced week accessibility validation for athlete/admin write paths
- Implemented `TrainingSessionController` write methods:
  - `store` returns `201` + `TrainingSessionResource`
  - `update` returns `200` + `TrainingSessionResource`
  - `destroy` returns `204`
  - policy checks applied for create/update/delete; coach write access remains denied
- Added `tests/Feature/Api/TrainingSessionCrudApiTest.php` covering:
  - auth required
  - athlete own create/update/delete
  - athlete forbidden cross-athlete mutation
  - admin full mutation
  - coach forbidden (`403`)
  - validation failures for invalid week, date outside week range, missing required fields
- Verification completed:
  - `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --dirty --format agent`
  - `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact tests/Feature/Api/TrainingSessionCrudApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingSessionReadApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingWeekReadApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingWeekCrudApiTest.php` (23 passed)
- Wired athlete-only TrainingSession write interactions into calendar UI (frontend-only):
  - create modal triggered from empty day cells / add button
  - edit modal triggered from session row click
  - delete action with explicit confirmation in edit modal
  - all writes call existing API routes (`store` / `update` / `destroy`) via Wayfinder route helpers
  - backend validation errors render inline in the modal
  - successful writes reload calendar data from real backend props
  - role gating enforced: only `auth.user.role === 'athlete'` can trigger write affordances; non-athletes remain read-only
- Frontend verification completed:
  - `vendor/bin/sail npm run types`
- Implemented coach-athlete assignment backbone (backend-first):
  - added `coach_athlete_assignments` table with:
    - `coach_id` FK
    - `athlete_id` FK
    - unique `(coach_id, athlete_id)`
    - cascading deletes
  - added `CoachAthleteAssignment` model
  - added `User` relationships:
    - `coachedAthletes()`
    - `coaches()`
- Updated assignment-aware authorization and read scoping:
  - policies now allow coach read access only for assigned athletes
  - coach write access remains denied for plans/weeks/sessions/activities
  - dashboard + API read controllers (`TrainingPlan`, `TrainingWeek`, `TrainingSession`) now scope coach collections to assigned athletes only
- Implemented read-only coach view enablement:
  - added `CoachAthleteIndexController` for assigned-athlete directory props
  - added `AthleteCalendarController` for coach/admin athlete calendar viewing
  - wired `/coaches` to assigned-athlete directory with real Inertia props
  - wired `/athletes/{athlete}` to reuse existing calendar page in read-only coach context
  - added contextual calendar header text: `Viewing athlete: {name}`
  - kept athlete calendar composition unchanged
- Extended deterministic visual seeders:
  - seeded three deterministic athletes with plans/weeks/sessions
  - seeded one coach assigned to all three athletes
- Added/updated tests:
  - `tests/Feature/CoachAthleteAssignmentTest.php`
  - `tests/Feature/CoachCalendarReadAccessTest.php`
  - updated existing coach read assertions in plan/week/session read API tests for assignment-aware behavior
- Validation completed:
  - `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --dirty --format agent`
  - `vendor/bin/sail npm run types`
  - `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact tests/Feature/CoachAthleteAssignmentTest.php tests/Feature/CoachCalendarReadAccessTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingPlanReadApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingPlanCrudApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingWeekReadApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingWeekCrudApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingSessionReadApiTest.php tests/Feature/Api/TrainingSessionCrudApiTest.php tests/Feature/NavigationShellPagesTest.php tests/Feature/DashboardTest.php` (46 passed)

Next milestone:
→ Build admin impersonation groundwork on top of assignment-aware access, while keeping coach write permissions disabled.
